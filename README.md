# bias-mitigation-using-ai-tools
This repository is designed to detect and mitigate bias in AI models using fairness techniques. Bias in AI can lead to unfair decision-making, especially in areas like hiring, lending, and law enforcement. The project demonstrates how to analyze and reduce bias using Python and AI fairness tools.

# Bias Mitigation in AI  

## Overview
